## Test app for firebase-js-sdk/issues/6715

This test app was written in an attempt to investigate/reproduce
https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/6715

## Usage

1. Edit `firebase_config.ts` to fill out your `apiKey` and `projectId`
   (not required if you only want to use the Firestore emulator).
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to generate the compiled JavaScript.
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser, and click the "Run Test" button.
